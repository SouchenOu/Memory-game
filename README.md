# Avito-challenge


---> The code iterates over each image in the sorted images array, creating a card for each image.
Each card is a div element containing an img element.

A click event listener is added to each card to handle the game's logic:

*Prevents action if the board is locked or if the same card is clicked twice.

*Flips the card by adding the boxOpen class.

*Manages the selection of the first and second cards.

*Calls the CheckIfItMatch() function to check if the two selected cards match.




--->I've finished implementing this tasks :



*Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

*Display a grid of cards (e.g., 4x4 or 6x6) with the backside facing up.

*Each card should have a unique symbol or image on the front side.

*Shuffle the cards randomly every time the game starts or restarts.

*When a player clicks on a card, flip it to reveal the front side.

*Allow the player to select two cards at a time.

*If the two cards have the same symbol or image, keep them face up.

*If the two cards do not match, flip them back face down after a short delay.

*Keep track of the player's score (number of successful matches) and display it on the page.

*Display a message or modal when the player successfully matches all the pairs.

*Style the game using CSS to make it visually appealing.

*Make sure the game is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

*Write concise and well-structured code with appropriate comments.
